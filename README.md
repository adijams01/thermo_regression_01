## Abstract
Weather prediction is one of the most important research areas due to its applicability in real-world problems like meteorology, agricultural studies, etc.

We propose a method for temperature prediction using machine learning model - [Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

 Also we took in account factors like 
* [Latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude)
* [Altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude)
* [Precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation)
* [Humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity)
* [Windspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windspeed)

The experimental results are evaluated using  [Mean Absolute Error (MAE)](),this error metric shows that how much precise our model is for temperature prediction.

## Data

The [data](https://github.com/adijams01/thermo_regression_01/blob/main/thermodynamics_csv.csv) :computer: was collected by us through various website :scroll:

variation of features against temperature can see like below figure [here](https://github.com/adijams01/thermo_regression_01/blob/main/Data_Graphs.ipynb)
