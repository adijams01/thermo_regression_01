## Abstract
Weather prediction is one of the most important research areas due to its applicability in real-world problems like meteorology, agricultural studies, etc.

We propose a method for temperature prediction using three machine learning models -
* Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
* Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
through a comparative analysis using the weather data collected.

 Also we took in account factors like 
* [Latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude)
* [Altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude)
* [Precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation)
* [Humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity)
* [Windspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windspeed)

The experimental results are evaluated using 
* Mean Error (ME)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
* Correlation Coefficients (CC)
The error metrics and the CC shows that MLR is a more precise model for temperature prediction than ANN and SVM.
